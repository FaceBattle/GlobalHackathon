Please spread the truth:\n\n(1) Bernie\u2019s proposals would cost less than what we\u2019d spend without them. Most of the \u201ccost\u201d the Journal comes up with\u2014$15 trillion\u2014would pay for opening Medicare to everyone. This would be cheaper than relying on our current system of for-profit private health insurers that charge you and me huge administrative costs, advertising, marketing, bloated executive salaries, and high pharmaceutical prices. (Gerald Friedman, an economist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, estimates a Medicare-for-all system would actually save all of us $10 trillion over 10 years).\n\n(2) The savings from Medicare-for-all would more than cover the costs of the rest of Bernie\u2019s agenda\u2014tuition-free education at public colleges, expanded Social Security benefits, improved infrastructure, and a fund to help cover paid family leave \u2013 and still leave us $2 trillion to cut federal deficits for the next ten years.\n\n(3) Many of these other \u201ccosts\" would also otherwise be paid by individuals and families -- for example, in college tuition and private insurance. So they shouldn't be considered added costs for the country as a whole, and may well save us money.\n\n(4) Finally, Bernie\u2019s proposed spending on education and infrastructure aren\u2019t really \u201cspending\u201d at all, but investments in the nation\u2019s future productivity. If we don\u2019t make them, we\u2019re all poorer.\n\nThat Rupert Murdoch's Wall Street Journal would do this giant dump on Bernie, based on misinformation and distortion, confirms Bernie's status as the candidate willing to take on the moneyed interests that the Wall Street Journal represents.

The total amount held outside the U.S. by the companies was up 8 percent from the previous year, though 58 companies reported smaller stockpiles.\n\nThe money pileup, reflecting companies\u2019 incentives to park profits in low-tax countries, has drawn the attention of President Barack Obama and U.S. lawmakers, who see a chance to tap the funds for spending programs and to revamp the tax code. That effort is stalled in Washington, and there are few signs that tech companies will bring the profits back to the U.S. until Congress gives them an incentive or a mandate.\n\n\u201cIt just makes no sense to repatriate, pay a substantial tax on it,\u201d said Joseph Kennedy, a senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a policy-research group whose board of directors includes executives from Microsoft and Oracle Corp. \u201cComputing and IT companies especially have a lot of flexibility in where they declare their profits.\u201d\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/u-s-companies-are-stashing-2-1-trillion-overseas-to-avoid-taxes", "type": "link", "id": "124955570892789_801568289898177"}, {"attachments": {"data": [{"url": "http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FsP3h49TCPkc&h=FAQEc5qHU&s=1&enc=AZNdGf_UuVj18jEbH0jhvMWoPeuY3QdwxOsbeepUe-orlI0bXVP4YnBKduYO108gdrkicHEtmuR90mHU5LmrXcqC", "type": "video_share_youtube", "title": "Sanders on Netanyahu Speech"}]}, "comments": {"summary": {"total_count": 155, "can_comment": false, "order": "ranked"}}, "likes": {"summary": {"total_count": 2261, "has_liked": false, "can_like": false}}, "created_time": "2015-03-04T19:50:51+0000", "message": "Sanders on Netanyahu Speech: http://youtu.be/sP3h49TCPkc", "type": "video", "id": "124955570892789_800324546689218"}, {"attachments": {"data": [{"url": "https://www.facebook.com/berniesanders/photos/a.324119347643076.89553.124955570892789/799721956749477/?type=3", "type": "photo", "title": "Timeline Photos"}]}, "comments": {"summary": {"total_count": 225, "can_comment": false, "order": "ranked"}}, "likes": {"summary": {"total_count": 10529, "has_liked": false, "can_like": false}}, "created_time": "2015-03-03T21:16:01+0000", "type": "photo", "id": "124955570892789_799859766735696"}, {"attachments": {"data": [{"url": "https://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fberniesanders.com%2Fpetition%2Frebuild-america%2F&h=vAQHuFKKL&s=1&enc=AZPLWaNEc0mfeUqYupMiCqa8XRQlWJqzrdZsDDUxHyVOp23YKav0jv_e466BA4PKpHHJbJP0335-qoEs19T0zHrS", "type": "share", "description": "Sign the petition to tell Congress that Americans want a big infrastructure jobs program.", "title": "Petition: Rebuild America and Create Jobs"}]}, "comments": {"summary": {"total_count": 170, "can_comment": false, "order": "ranked"}}, "likes": {"summary": {"total_count": 7433, "has_liked": false, "can_like": false}}, "created_time": "2015-03-03T00:07:01+0000", "message": "Sign here if you believe it's time to put Americans back to work rebuilding America: https://berniesanders.com/petition/rebuild-america/", "type": "link", "id": "124955570892789_799263116795361"}, {"attachments": {"data": [{"url": "https://www.facebook.com/berniesanders/photos/a.324119347643076.89553.124955570892789/799287256792947/?type=3", "type": "photo", "description": "Affordable Dental Health Care for Veterans, Children and Others Should Be a Right - Sen.

I will soon be introducing legislation for a $1 trillion investment, over five years, to modernize our country's physical infrastructure. This bill will not just rebuild our country but it will create and maintain 13 million good-paying jobs that our economy desperately needs.\n\nFor most of our history, the United States proudly led the world in building innovative infrastructure, from a network of canals, to the transcontinental railroad, to the interstate highway system. We launched an ambitious rural electrification program, massive flood control projects and more.\n\nContinue reading here: http://www.cincinnati.com/story/opinion/contributors/2015/01/20/sanders-bridges-roads-need-trillion/22043933/", "type": "status", "id": "124955570892789_779357995452540"}, {"attachments": {"data": [{"url": "https://www.facebook.com/berniesanders/photos/a.324119347643076.89553.124955570892789/778889252166081/?type=3", "type": "photo", "title": "Timeline Photos"}]}, "comments": {"summary": {"total_count": 400, "can_comment": false, "order": "ranked"}}, "likes": {"summary": {"total_count": 18542, "has_liked": false, "can_like": false}}, "created_time": "2015-01-18T17:00:00+0000", "type": "photo", "id": "124955570892789_778889368832736"}, {"attachments": {"data": [{"url": "https://www.facebook.com/berniesanders/photos/a.324119347643076.89553.124955570892789/778436755544664/?type=3", "type": "photo", "title": "Timeline Photos"}]}, "comments": {"summary": {"total_count": 439, "can_comment": false, "order": "ranked"}}, "likes": {"summary": {"total_count": 11637, "has_liked": false, "can_like": false}}, "created_time": "2015-01-17T17:00:00+0000", "type": "photo", "id": "124955570892789_778437562211250"}, {"attachments": {"data": [{"url": "https://www.facebook.com/berniesanders/photos/a.324119347643076.89553.124955570892789/777751148946558/?type=3", "type": "photo", "title": "Timeline Photos"}]}, "comments": {"summary": {"total_count": 941, "can_comment": false, "order": "ranked"}}, "likes": {"summary": {"total_count": 15448, "has_liked": false, "can_like": false}}, "created_time": "2015-01-16T22:45:53+0000", "type": "photo", "id": "124955570892789_777751198946553"}, {"attachments": {"data": [{"url": "https://www.facebook.com/berniesanders/photos/a.324119347643076.89553.124955570892789/777323358989337/?type=3", "type": "photo", "title": "Timeline Photos"}]}, "comments": {"summary": {"total_count": 249, "can_comment": false, "order": "ranked"}}, "likes": {"summary": {"total_count": 12566, "has_liked": false, "can_like": false}}, "created_time": "2015-01-15T21:35:03+0000", "type": "photo", "id": "124955570892789_777323458989327"}, {"attachments": {"data": [{"url": "http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FlQQQD4RNdLM&h=8AQF5dEgn&s=1&enc=AZN7Ri9OUgg6eOizsjjwcrVoELWOPGXM8VrvmXf64TTKDyNtJrtIgVz48_5hTrSgtK3EQQYUGuZHMDDN25uOXm7N", "type": "video_share_youtube", "title": "Put Them on Record"}]}, "comments": {"summary": {"total_count": 42, "can_comment": false, "order": "ranked"}}, "likes": {"summary": {"total_count": 1610, "has_liked": false, "can_like": false}}, "created_time": "2015-01-14T16:27:22+0000", "message": "Put Them on the Record: http://youtu.be/lQQQD4RNdLM", "type": "video", "id": "124955570892789_776790332375973"}, {"attachments": {"data": [{"url": "http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FzL2mkOdUKmM&h=OAQEH9L8R&s=1&enc=AZOIfhda8g7JCChqyOueEpcStkNqWk6q7cwgpW7N7izN7eU76tFV0gOr-ycl3Hb6Zn8nYd6oxeDmR3YP_mtKPEtf", "type": "video_share_youtube", "title": "Don't Deny the Science"}]}, "comments": {"summary": {"total_count": 25, "can_comment": false, "order": "ranked"}}, "likes": {"summary": {"total_count": 1456, "has_liked": false, "can_like": false}}, "created_time": "2015-01-13T22:37:11+0000", "message": "Don't Deny the Science: http://youtu.be/zL2mkOdUKmM", "type": "video", "id": "124955570892789_776495935738746"}, {"attachments": {"data": [{"url": "https://www.facebook.com/berniesanders/photos/a.324119347643076.89553.124955570892789/776442645744075/?type=3", "type": "photo", "title": "Timeline Photos"}]}, "comments": {"summary": {"total_count": 778, "can_comment": false, "order": "ranked"}}, "likes": {"summary": {"total_count": 17095, "has_liked": false, "can_like": false}}, "created_time": "2015-01-13T20:14:16+0000", "type": "photo", "id": "124955570892789_776442699077403"}, {"attachments": {"data": [{"url": "https://www.facebook.com/berniesanders/photos/a.324119347643076.89553.124955570892789/775742522480754/?type=3", "type": "photo", "title": "Timeline Photos"}]}, "comments": {"summary": {"total_count": 847, "can_comment": false, "order": "ranked"}}, "likes": {"summary": {"total_count": 18540, "has_liked": false, "can_like": false}}, "created_time": "2015-01-12T16:07:18+0000", "type": "photo", "id": "124955570892789_775742575814082"}, {"attachments": {"data": [{"url": "http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3661552%2Fbernie-sanders-pope-francis%2F&h=YAQEjzhAs&s=1&enc=AZO8V1ILbiIsQlUmUuIJ9ftDcGRu0RyOdBmwOmlynOwWsT1C-poF9JmxIUMtUvzBAYnqS-3kfX2K6hynYJTKaKPY", "type": "share", "description": "Sen.

Violent crime arrests plummeted - Washington Post:\n\nIn a year full of distressing stories \u2014 especially about race, crime and violence in urban neighborhoods \u2014 this one points to some hope. Earlier this December, we covered a summer jobs program in Chicago that appeared to lead to fewer teenage arrests for violent crime. Our original story, republished below, also reminds us that policy solutions are possible \u2014 and possibly even inexpensive.\n\nA couple of years ago, the city of Chicago started a summer jobs programfor teenagers attending high schools in some of the city's high-crime, low-income neighborhoods. The program was meant, of course, to connect students to work. But officials also hoped that it might curb the kinds of problems \u2014 like higher crime \u2014 that arise when there's no work to be found.\n\nResearch on the program conducted by the University of Chicago Crime Lab and just published in the journal Science suggests that these summer jobs have actually had such an effect: Students who were randomly assigned to participate in the program had 43 percent fewer violent-crime arrests over 16 months, compared to students in a control group.\n\nThat number is striking for a couple of reasons: It implies that a relatively short (and inexpensive) intervention like an eight-week summer jobs program can have a lasting effect on teenage behavior.
