They are not a JV team, Mr. President. They are not contained. They are at our shores and their measure of victory is the body count.\n\nI am angry that Hillary Clinton dares to ask \u201cwhat difference does it make\u201d how four Americans died in Benghazi. And then she tells us that we must empathize with our enemies. Mrs. Clinton, when the United States does not answer a purposeful terrorist attack on our embassy with a purposeful and powerful response, but instead blames a video, you invite more terrorism and bloodshed.\n\nI am angry that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton declared victory in Iraq in 2011, abandoned all our hard-won gains for political expediency and contrary to the advice of our generals, thus leaving vast swaths of territory and too much weaponry to be gobbled up by ISIS.\n\nI am angry that President Obama unilaterally decides that we\u2019ll accept refugees while his administration admits we cannot determine their ties to terrorism.\n\nMostly I am outraged because the murder, mayhem, danger and tragedy we see unfolding in Paris, throughout the Middle East and too often in our own homeland, are the direct consequence of this administration\u2019s policies. You cannot lead from behind.\n\nThe world is a tragic and dangerous place when we do not lead. We cannot be the world\u2019s policeman, but we must be the world\u2019s leader. And so let us consider why only America can lead the world.\n\nOur nation was founded on a unique premise:  that each individual life has value, that we judge an individual by the content of their character, as Martin Luther King said, not by the group to which they belong. Our nation was founded on the idea that each of us has the right to fulfill our potential \u2013 life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness \u2013 and our Founders said this right comes from God and should not be taken away by government.\n\nOur Constitution was written as much to curb the abuse of power by government as it was to protect individual rights.\n\nWe are not a perfect nation and we have worked hard to become a more perfect union. But we are an exceptional nation. And it is nevertheless true that more things have been more possible for more people regardless of their circumstances here, than anywhere else on earth. And it is also true that we are the only nation in the history of the world that possesses military superiority and yet uses that power not to conquer territory or to subjugate others, but to liberate, uplift and comfort people around the world.\n\nThis, Mr. President, is why we are an exceptional nation.

They repeated the talking points from Planned Parenthood that told them there was no footage of an aborted baby at all. Now that it's clear the video is of an aborted baby left to die in a metal tray kicking for life, they are calling it...stock footage. \n\nHillary Clinton has said she refuses to protect life even at 8 or 9 months because these late term abortions are only done out of medical necessity. That's not true. But the liberal media let her get away with it anyway.\n\nPlanned Parenthood doesn't deny they are delivering babies alive and harvesting their organs. They don't deny they perform late term abortions that aren't out of medical necessity. They don't deny they are butchering babies. They just don't want you to know about it.\n\nI visited a pregnancy center in South Carolina last week. A wonderful woman named Lacey let us watch the ultrasound of her nearly 18 week old baby boy. He was beautiful. Planned Parenthood, on the other hand, tweeted out \"ugh\" when they found out I visited a pregnancy center that didn't perform abortions. \n\nWhile the Left insists that taxpayers should give money to Planned Parenthood at all costs, they refuse to allow any public funding for pregnancy centers that won't perform abortions. This isn't about women's health for them.

In 2013, I was in an argument on TV in which I once again said, \"I think Obamacare remains an abomination.\" As part of that argument, I also said that I would agree with the conservative Heritage Foundation's catastrophic coverage mandate as part of a plan that would ensure those with preexisting conditions could be covered. Since then, conservative health care experts have come up with significantly better alternatives to ObamaCare, including Representative Price's and Governor Walker's, just to name a couple. To be clear, I believe that we must find a way to cover people with pre-existing conditions--but I do not believe we need a mandate of any kind to do that.\n\nAs with many of our nation's festering problems, the issue has never been a lack of good, conservative ideas. We know what we need to do to solve this problem. First and foremost, we have to repeal ObamaCare. Then we have to replace it with a plan that protects those with pre-existing conditions in state-run high-risk pools, reduces costs, protects religious liberty and moves us closer to the one thing we've never tried before in health insurance: real competition.\n\nThere are a number of good plans for how to do this, but once again, the professional political class has failed us.

I believe that responsibility should have remained with states and voters where this conversation has continued in churches, town halls and living rooms around the country. \n\nMoving forward, however, all of our effort should be focused on protecting the religious liberties and freedom of conscience for those Americans that profoundly disagree with today's decision. \n\nThe Court did not and could not end this debate today.

Instead of more affordable care, premiums are rising. Instead of allowing those with insurance to stay on the plans they knew and liked, millions of people have been compelled to buy health plans that they didn't want. Many have been forced to move to Medicaid and yet more doctors are refusing to take Medicaid patients under this law. We were promised improved access and higher-quality care, but the complexity of ObamaCare is preventing the very competition that would allow more and better options for patients. Instead, hospitals, drug companies, and insurance companies are all consolidating. Instead of reducing the need for emergency care, we\u2019re seeing more ER visits. There are a whole set of problems we\u2019ve created and it has become clear that this law isn\u2019t working.\n \nThe lasting solution here is what we've been saying all along. We need to repeal ObamaCare. It hasn't worked. We need to do the one thing we've never tried in our healthcare system\u2014real competition. We know that competition provides lower prices and higher quality. But instead of a free market, healthcare so far has been a regulated oligopoly. We used to regulate insurance companies in all 50 states and now, we\u2019ve nationalized that process. All Americans agreed with President Obama's goals of quality, affordable care, but that is not what we got. And competition doesn\u2019t mean eliminating care for those with preexisting conditions. States should administer high-risk pools for those who have real needs. We\u2019ve seen this in action \u2013 New Hampshire was able to administer high-risk pools effectively before Obamacare.\n \nPeople are frustrated with a political class in Washington more interested in preserving their own power than solving the problems in front of them. Americans want Washington to stand up for them, to step up to the plate and solve the very real problems facing our nation. They want better access and better care \u2013 things that we know only come from competition. This doesn't mean we end all regulations on our healthcare industry. But it does mean we find a fair balance that ensures access and quality while ending the grip of crony capitalism on our healthcare market. It\u2019s time for a real solution: repeal Obamacare and let the free market\u2014not more crony capitalism\u2014improve access and care for all Americans.", "type": "status", "id": "261624820205_10156083223685206"}, {"attachments": {"data": [{"url": "https://www.facebook.com/CarlyFiorina/photos/a.10150190759645206.427734.261624820205/10156079516735206/?type=3", "type": "photo", "description": "Tomorrow Night on Sean Hannity, I sit down for a full hour interview.

Women are not simply 50% of our population or our workforce \u2013 they are 50% of our potential.\n\nWhile this debate has often been politicized by those on the left with cherry-picked statistics and quasi-facts, we do know that women don't always get compensated fairly and that we can do more. We also know that the White House and Hillary Clinton don't pay women the same as men by their own measures. But these political fights and hashtags too often obscure the practices and policies that are truly keeping women from achieving their full potential. \n\nFirst, we have laws on the books today that ban gender discrimination, and if a woman is being discriminated against because of her gender, she should use the full extent of that law. \n\nIt is also clear, however, that the single greatest impediment to equal pay for equal work is the seniority system, which pays not on merit and not on performance, but on time and grade. We don\u2019t need increased regulation to address this issue; we need flexibility for employers. \n\nThe federal government can lead this charge by dismantling its seniority system \u2013 a system that rewards employees for time in grade, not for merit, performance or hard work. This structure systematically disadvantages women and must be reformed. \n\nAnd who is it who supports the seniority system? Unions, government bureaucracies, the very constituencies that Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party represent and which support them. So while the left likes to politicize this issue, they refuse to take on the seniority system and agree to pay women by merit and by their results.\n\nWhen Hillary Clinton proposes increased regulation to address statistics that she won't apply to her own office, she obscures the real problem and prevents us from finding solutions. In fact, Democrats' calls for increased regulation would hurt female employees, making it easier for trial lawyers to line their pockets and harder to provide workplace flexibility and merit pay. This would be devastating to small businesses, which employ more than half of our women. These types of proposals from the left are clearly more about politics than solutions.\n\nLike you, I am committed to equal work for equal pay. Now let\u2019s work together to find the solutions that will unlock our nation\u2019s full potential.", "type": "status", "id": "261624820205_10155719136945206"}, {"attachments": {"data": [{"url": "http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wctcam.com%2Flisten%2F&h=JAQGY-jjW&s=1&enc=AZPGj2pXkD5CPlNPh15NPTfa3780JZeI8PBNimvo37GbguGoxgZwZStf0_a9oeHiALmDt67DmQzhNg456I8eDxmy", "type": "share", "title": "1450 WCTC Listen Live"}]}, "comments": {"summary": {"total_count": 26, "can_comment": false, "order": "ranked"}}, "likes": {"summary": {"total_count": 345, "has_liked": false, "can_like": false}}, "created_time": "2015-04-14T13:20:25+0000", "message": "I\u2019m getting ready to join Laura Ingraham on the air in a few minutes.

This is a discussion of critical importance for our country.\n \nToo often, we see people who are prevented from practicing their religion because of a government mandate. A Muslim prisoner was not permitted to keep a beard until his religious rights were vindicated in court. A Native American kindergarten student was told he was required to cut his hair in order to attend school, despite his family\u2019s insistence on the religious significance of his long hair. Once again, the courts stepped in to protect his religious rights against government overreach.\n \nThe federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, signed into law by President Clinton in 1993, is an important law because it protects these rights against government intrusion. However, because the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act does not apply to the states, 20 states have passed their own religious freedom laws and an additional 12 states have introduced legislation to ensure that the citizens of their states have the opportunity to practice their religions freely. It has not and has never been a license to discriminate. \n\nThe debate about gay marriage is really a debate about how the government bestows benefits and whether they should be bestowed equally. I believe they should. I also believe that people of religious conviction know that marriage is a religious institution with a spiritual foundation because only a man and a woman can create life, which is a gift that comes from God. We must protect their rights as well.\n\nI hope that we come to a place in this country where we are prepared to have respectful differences and tolerate those two views. Religious liberty and tolerance are too important to our country. \n \nIt is frankly sad to me that politics has become a fact-free zone. It is sad that so many people on the left were quick to turn this into a divisive and destructive debate so they could further their own brand of identity politics. It is sad that CEOs took to Twitter before checking their facts, adding to the division instead of helping build tolerance. \n\nThis debate represents what so many believe is wrong with our politics. It has taken an emotional issue for people on both sides and politicians have used it to divide and to score points with their team. \n\nIt has been tough for some in the media to understand my position because I refuse to join the game of name calling and vitriol. Politics shouldn't be a game, however. We must find a way to respect one another, to celebrate a culture that protects religious freedom while condemning discrimination.", "type": "status", "id": "261624820205_10155659402305206"}, {"attachments": {"data": [{"url": "https://www.facebook.com/CarlyFiorina/videos/10155658252195206/", "type": "video_inline"}]}, "comments": {"summary": {"total_count": 22, "can_comment": false, "order": "ranked"}}, "likes": {"summary": {"total_count": 392, "has_liked": false, "can_like": false}}, "created_time": "2015-04-01T18:21:41+0000", "message": "People are tired of the fact-free nature of politics & people recognize that government is out of control.", "type": "video", "id": "261624820205_10155658252195206"}, {"attachments": {"data": [{"url": "http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1CHwd3u&h=RAQHAiDKD&s=1&enc=AZMQtulhZJ0L4Ve-DpWEAE4puLg8BcE9j8_dCCGtcv7djqwPXo3_xQs0S01dfvVfRFp5Jc7lGZLx_YlOl4Hjjhs8", "type": "share", "title": "1450 WCTC Listen Live"}]}, "comments": {"summary": {"total_count": 21, "can_comment": false, "order": "ranked"}}, "likes": {"summary": {"total_count": 487, "has_liked": false, "can_like": false}}, "created_time": "2015-04-01T13:21:49+0000", "message": "Our government must be reimagined; its size, complexity, cost, and power in our lives now work against the interest of the people.
