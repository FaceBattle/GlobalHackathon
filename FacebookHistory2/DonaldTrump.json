Trump has ordered all flags at Trump properties around the country to be flown at half-staff in honor of the five fallen soldiers who were tragically killed in last week's shooting. Mr. Trump has long been a dedicated supporter of our military and our Veterans and if the President won't act, he will.\n\nMr. Trump stated, \"This disgraceful omission is unacceptable and yet another example of our incompetent politicians. It is a simple yet meaningful and important gesture that signifies our respect and recognition for these great soldiers who lost their lives. We must do better for all Americans, especially our military. We must Make America Great Again!\"\n\nIn addition to the lowering of the flags, Mr. Trump has established a hotline (855- VETS- 352) and email address (veterans@donaldtrump.com) for Veterans to share their stories about the need to reform our Veterans Administration.\n\nIf he is elected President he will take care of these and all Veteran complaints very quickly and efficiently like a world-class business man can do, but a politician has no clue.", "type": "status", "id": "153080620724_10155867589100725"}, {"comments": {"summary": {"total_count": 8917, "can_comment": false, "order": "ranked"}}, "likes": {"summary": {"total_count": 64148, "has_liked": false, "can_like": false}}, "created_time": "2015-07-21T16:20:21+0000", "message": "I am not at all surprised by the Des Moines Register's sophomoric editorial.
