But without it I had maybe two weeks left. The hospital was cold. I'd never felt air conditioning before. \n\nLife in the White Palace (Granddad\u2019s nickname for hospital) meant I got to grow up surrounded by children just like me. We were mostly bald, all tubed, taped, bandaged up and stitched back together. We were all missing parts, some obvious like eyes or legs, others more hidden, like lungs and kidneys. Those who still could, tip-toed around like little fairies because chemotherapy had destroyed the muscles in our legs and it hurt to put our heels on the floor. But we were all together, so no one's appearance came into question. No one got laughed at or teased. We were all we knew. \n\nAnd then I got really lucky. I survived, my hair grew back and I got strong again. I look relatively normal on the outside, but on the inside, I am still the same stitched back together little creature, in a world where people are judged so harshly for the way they look. It has always been completely incomprehensible to me. How can people think there's time for that? \n\nI was really inspired when I heard a story about a little girl who said she couldn't be a princess because she didn't have long hair, and I wanted her, and others like her to know that's not what makes a princess, or a warrior, or a superhero. It's not what makes you beautiful either. It's your insides that count\u2026 even if you happen to be missing half of them. \n\nEvery scar tells a story, every baldhead, every dark circle, every prosthetic limb, and every reflection in a mirror that you might not recognize anymore. Look deeper than skin, hair, nails, and lips. You are who you are in your bones. That is where you have the potential to shine the brightest from. It is where your true beautiful self lives. \n\nThank you ABC network and particularly our creator, Callie Khouri for letting me change Scarlett's hair, and my team, family and friends for helping me make the decision. If it makes even one person think twice about judging another, then in some small way, the world is better. \nSelf-esteem takes a lot longer to grow back than hair. \n\n#BeautyWithin\n\nPhoto credit - Joseph Llanes Photography", "title": "Timeline Photos"}]}, "comments": {"summary": {"total_count": 381, "order": "ranked"}}, "likes": {"summary": {"total_count": 9395}}, "created_time": "2015-11-13T01:45:00+0000", "message": "We\u2019re so much more than just hair.

We have 5 percent of the world\u2019s population and 25 percent of the world\u2019s prison population. Many Americans behind bars right now are low-level offenders, predominantly drug users. Keeping them in prison does little to reduce crime, but it does a lot to tear families and communities apart. Right now, one out of every 28 children in America has a parent in prison. You talk about the pipeline that goes from the cradle to prison; it starts when a family is broken up for no real reason. And I\u2019ll tell you something else: We need to get rid of private prisons and detention centers. The power to keep people locked up should not be in the hands of unaccountable corporations. \u2026 I also want us to eliminate finally the disparity in sentencing between crack and cocaine. It keeps our prisons full and unfairly impacts African Americans. We\u2019ve made progress on it in the last years, but not enough.
