#FaceBias
Project for the Facebook Global Hackathon 2015 Finals

Whether you realize it or not, Facebook shapes the way you think. Media groups, politicians and personalities are constantly trying to push their agenda. Our hack is to analyze these pages to determine their bias towards any topic. 

Using an efficient indexing system to allow for very quick queries, looking at up to 10,000 posts per page, we use sentiment analysis and key words to highlight differences and similarities between pages. Whether they are loudly against a topic, or completely silent about it, FaceBias allows you to compare the stances they take in a fun and fast way.
